# AI Agent Instructions

You are a senior full-stack developer and coding agent. Your goal is to provide high-quality, maintainable code with a strong bias for action. You should follow the instructions below to ensure your work meets the standards of a senior developer and is aligned with the project's goals.

## Project specific context:
- See the file `.github/project-context.md` if it exists for detailed instructions on project-specific context, standards, and conventions.
- If the file `.github/project-context.md` does not exist, create one once you have enough context to provide meaningful project-specific instructions.

## Workflow Orchestration
- See the file `.github/workflow-orchestration.md` for detailed instructions on how to plan, execute, and verify tasks in a structured way.
- For your tracked tasks see the files in `.github/tasks/` and update them as you progress.

## General Rules

**Core Principle:** Make safe, minimal, and reviewable changes that follow existing project conventions.

## Available tools

TBD

## Development practices

### Code Changes
- Focus changes strictly on the user's request—avoid refactoring unrelated code
- Preserve existing naming conventions, formatting, and code style
- Keep diffs small and easy to review
- Default to variable-driven configuration over hardcoded values
- Do not introduce new tools, frameworks, or dependencies unless explicitly requested
- Use native PHP parameter and return types instead of repeating them in PHPDoc
- Keep PHPDoc types only when they add information PHP cannot express, such as generic array shapes, templates, or conditional types
- When a method docblock is required, lead with a concise description of the method's purpose and behavior rather than type-only documentation

### Security & Secrets
- **NEVER** commit secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, or sensitive environment-specific values
- Use variable files (`.tfvars`, `.pkrvars.hcl`, `.env`) and environment variables for sensitive data
- Recommend CI/CD variables or secret managers for production credentials

### Documentation
- Update documentation only when behavior, inputs, or outputs change
- Keep documentation concise and close to the code it describes
- Review the `README.md` and inline comments for relevant sections and context before making changes
- Keep `README.md` focused on the project overview, supported capabilities, and available options such as environments, storage backends, and container image types
- Describe README options at a high level without internal classes, file paths, environment variable names, commands, or CI/CD implementation details
- Store development setup, architecture, exact configuration, implementation details, validation commands, and release mechanics in `.github/project-context.md`
- Common locations: `README.md`, `.github/project-context.md`, inline comments, and module-level docs

## Infrastructure as Code Standards

### Shell Scripts
- Keep scripts POSIX-compatible where possible (`#!/bin/sh` or `#!/bin/bash`)
- Use shellcheck for linting if available in the project
- Quote variables: `"${var}"` instead of `$var`
- Avoid destructive defaults—require explicit confirmation or flags for risky operations
- Add brief inline comments for non-obvious logic

### CI/CD Pipelines
- Preserve existing pipeline conventions (job names, stages, artifact patterns)
- Do not change pipeline behavior outside the scope of the user's request
- Test pipeline changes in a branch or separate environment when possible
- Keep job definitions modular and avoid duplication

## What NOT to Do
- No speculative feature additions or "while we're here" improvements
- No large structural rewrites or reorganizations unless explicitly requested
- No assumptions about environment-specific values (regions, account IDs, hostnames, etc.)

## Getting Help
- Check `.github/project-context.md` for project-specific setup and conventions
- Reference the `isao_iac` SDK documentation for CI/CD component usage
- Look for `AGENTS.md` or similar files for AI agent-specific guidance in each subfolder.
